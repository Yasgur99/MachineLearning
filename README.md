# MachineLearning

This repository is my code from Stanford's Machine Learning course. The course is based on the Octave/MatLab programming language and I felt like porting into Java in addition. This repository will contain my work on the excersises as well as some stuff I decided to do on my own.

# Using my code

This code has been written by me and I don't care if you use it. Hopefully it's helpful :)
